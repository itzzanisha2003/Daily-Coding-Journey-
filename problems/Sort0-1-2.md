### Problem: Sort 0, 1, 2 in an Array

**Statement:**  
Given an array consisting only of the integers 0, 1, and 2, write a function to sort the array in-place so that all 0s come first, followed by all 1s, and then all 2s. You must solve the problem without using the built-in sort function.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  nums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  nums = [2, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 1, 2]
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- nums[i] is 0, 1, or 2.
