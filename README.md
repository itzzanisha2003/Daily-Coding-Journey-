# Daily Coding Journey

Welcome to my public daily coding journal! 🚀

## What is this?

This repository documents my day-to-day progress in learning, building, and exploring new coding concepts, challenges, and projects. Each day, I’ll add a log entry sharing what I worked on, what I learned, and what I plan to tackle next.

## Why build in public?

- **Accountability:** Stay consistent and track progress.
- **Reflection:** Learn by explaining and reviewing daily work.
- **Community:** Share the journey and connect with others.
